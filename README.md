# VGS-IC
 Incomplete VGS Test Submission

Initially, this was intended to be a learn as I go project, but I have hit the point where the amount of things I'm not familiar with is too high for me to continue in good faith and expediency.

app.py - This file contains the attempt at using python/Flask to create a form to process Credit Card data as indicated in the Test Task PDF that was sent to me.

config.py - This file contains an incomplete attempt to learn part of Flask, using a secret key as part of a separate config file.

forms.py - Like config.py, this file was how the author of the Flask tutorial I was following had instituted separate sections of his code, and I copied the endeavor.  Eventually, I included the text here directly into app.py.

main.css - A compilation of the CSS code used in the VGS starter documentation.

vgs-collect.js - The VGS-Collect javascript as provided by the task PDF.

vgs.js - An attempt to use the .js files included in the VGS Starter Documentation

Templates Folder - The Flask tutorial used templates to house HTML code/structure.
